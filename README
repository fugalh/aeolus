AEOLUS 0.6.6   RELEASE NOTES
============================


1. The stops directory
----------------------

The aeolus binary itself is a generic organ synth and
does not define any instrument. In order to use Aeolus
you need a directory containing definitions of stops
and of an instrument. The one supplied with the current
release has this structure:


 stops-0.3.0 
     |
     |___ Aeolus
     |        |          
     |        |____ definition
     |        |____ presets
     |
     |___ Aeolus1
     |        |          
     |        |____ definition
     |        |____ presets
     |
     |___ Aeolus2
     |        |          
     |        |____ definition
     |        |____ presets
     |
     |___ ***.ae0
     |___ ***.ae0 
     |___ ***.ae0
     |___ ...
     |
     |___ waves
              |
              |___ ***.ae1
              |___ ***.ae1
              |___ ***.ae1
              |___ ...


The 'Aeolus' directory is the default instrument
directory. It contains two files: a 'definition'
file that specifies the layout of the organ, and
'presets' that contains registration and midi presets.

There can be more than one instrument definition
directory (in fact there are two more examples
in the supplied stops directory). These can be
selected with a command line option (see below).

The data in 'presets' only makes sense for one
particular instrument, and that's why these files
are kept together with the corresponding instrument
definition. For binary distributions, there is a
configuration option that will make Aeolus save the
presets in the users's home (see below). This will
allow the user to save presets for one instrument.

The *.ae0 files contain parameters for the additive
synthesis. There is one such file for each rank of
pipes in the organ. These are binary files and they
should not be edited. 'Power users' can use the built-in
synthesis editor to modify them (see section 5).
  
The waves directory will be empty initially. When 
Aeolus starts up, it will compute wavetables, one for
each pipe. This is indicated by the flashing stop buttons.
The same will happen whenever the tuning or temperament is
changed. These wavetables can be saved (so Aeolus will be
ready for use much faster next time), but only if the stops
directory is writeable for the user. This will not be the
case for a binary installation as the stops dir will be
system-wide (e.g. /usr/share/Aeolus/stops-0.3.0).

In order to be able to save wavetables or edited stops
the stops directory must be copied to a location where
it can be modified by the user, (e.g. ~/stops-0.4.0).


2. Run-time configuration
-------------------------

Aeolus takes run-time options from three sources:

*  the file   /etc/aeolus.conf
*  the file   ~/.aeolusrc
*  command line options

Apart from empty lines and comments (lines starting with '#')
either of the files should just contain the command line options  
you want to use, on a single line (examples given below).

If the file in the home directory exists (even empty) then the
one in /etc is not used. Options given on the command line override
those given in either file.

Command line options are:

(audio interface)

  -J     Use JACK. This is also the default. The option 
         can be used to override a -A in the files.

  -A     Use ALSA. Aeolus should work with the "default"
         device, but in recent ALSA releases this has a
         very large buffer size, and this may result in 
         excessive latency. Use of a hardware device and
         the options below is recommended. 

         Sub-options for ALSA and their defaults are:

         -d <device>             (default)
         -r <sample rate>        (48000)
         -p <period size>        (1024)
         -n <number of periods>  (2) 

(output format)

  -B     This options selects direct Ambisionics first order
         B-format output, to be used for recording or with
         an external decoder. The default is stereo output.


(resources)

  -S  <stops directory>

         The default is ./stops.

  -I  <instrument directory>

         This is relative to the stops directory.
         The default is 'Aeolus'.
            
  -W  <waves directory> 

         This is relative to the stops directory.
         The default is 'waves'. This options mainly exists
         for use during development and should not be used.

  -u     This option is for use with binary distributions
         only. When used, the presets file will be stored
         into the user's home directory instead of within
         the system wide instrument directory.

(general)

  -t     Selects the text mode user interface. With this
         option Aeolus does not in any way depend on X11.
         In the current version the text mode UI does not
         provide full functionality.

  -h     Prints version information and a summary of all
         command line options. 


For example if you always use Aeolus with ALSA device hw:0,
using 3 periods of 512 frames and a sample rate of 44.1 kHz,
and you have copied the stops directory to your home, then
your ~/.aeolusrc could look like this:

# Aeolus default options
-A -d hw:0 -n 2 -p 512 -r 44100 -S /home/login/stops-0.3.0

where 'login' is your login name.


3. Binary packages
------------------

This release permits packagers to install a working Aeolus
without touching a users's home directory, as follows.

*  Install the aeolus binary in /usr/bin and the two
   plugins in /usr/lib.
*  Install the stops directory in /usr/share/Aeolus.
*  Install this README into /usr/share/doc/packages/Aeolus.
*  Create the file /etc/aeolus.conf containing:

# Aeolus default options
-u -A -S /usr/share/Aeolus/stops-0.3.0

This will use the default instrument 'Aeolus', and save the
presets in .aeolus-presets in the users's home directory.

6. Midi control of stop buttons
-------------------------------

The protocol uses one controller number. The default is #98, but you
can change this in global.h. The message is accepted only on channels
enabled for control in the midi matrix.

The value is interpreted as follows:

  v = 01mm0ggg 

      This type of messages (bit 6 set) selects a group, and either
      resets all stops in that group or sets the mode for the second
      form below.
      
      mm = mode. This can be:
    
         00  disabled, also resets all elements in the group.
         01  set off
         10  set on
         11  toggle

      ggg = group, one of the button groups as defined in the instrument
      definition. In the GUI groups start at the top, the first one (for
      division III) being group #0.

      The values of mm and ggg are stored and need not be repeated unless
      they change.

  v = 000bbbbb

      According to the current state of mode, this command switches a
      stop on or off, or toggles its state, or does nothing at all.
      
      bbbbb = button index within the group.

      Buttons are numbered left to right, top to bottom within each
      group. The first one is #0.
