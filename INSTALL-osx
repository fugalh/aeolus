AEOLUS 0.9.5  BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (OSX)
_____________________________________


As of version 0.8.2 Aeolus now works on OS X. At the time of this writing
(March 2008) you need a newer JACK[1] than that provided by Jack OSX[2] 
version 0.76. This means you won't be able to use JackPilot to manage
connections, but you can use QjackCtl[3] instead.

Aeolus registers itself as a CoreMIDI virtual destination. This means programs
like MidiKeys[4] will allow you to select Aeolus as a destination. A USB MIDI
driver will probably not automatically select Aeolus as a destination and
provide you no means for doing so yourself. For this you need to either use
MidiKeys with MIDI thru, or a patch bay such as MIDI Patchbay[5]. In my
experience MidiKeys is easier and more reliable, at least in the face of my
apparently-buggy USB MIDI driver.

Building Aeolus
---------------
Assuming you have all the dependencies worked out (see below), you just need to
make and make install using the proper makefile.

    ln -s Makefile-osx makefile
    make
    sudo make install

Building clthreads and clxclient works the same way.


Building JACK
-------------
Version 0.109.2 as of this writing.

    ./configure --with-default-tmpdir=/tmp
    make
    sudo make install

Building QjackCtl
-----------------
First, install Qt/Mac[6] (version 4.3.4 at the time of this writing). Then, in
the qjackctl-0.3.2 subdirectory, 

    ./configure
    make

This will produce an error like the following:

    make[1]: qjackctl.mak: No such file or directory
    make[1]: *** No rule to make target `qjackctl.mak'.  Stop.
    make: *** [qjackctl] Error 2

This is because Qt/Mac's qmake generates an Xcode project, not a makefile. Now
open that project in Xcode:

    open qjackctl.mak.xcodeproj

Build it and stash the resulting qjackctl.app somewhere convenient.
